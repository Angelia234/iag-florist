# It's All Good (IAG) Florist
Company profile for It's All Good Florist by Marina Mary

This company profile is my original design and code. This is my first css project i built for portfolio purposes and
to help my mom. I didn't copy it from any mentors code.

Branch master is the v.2, the much more cleaner version compared to branch v.1  which i created without Sass.
The project took 13 hours to build, and of course i didn't did it in one run.

I finished this project on 2 June 2020.
